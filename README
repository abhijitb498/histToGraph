PROGRAM TO PLOT FROM RAW HISTOGRAM FILE
AUTHOR, ABHIJIT BAISHYA


TO GENERATE THE EXECUTABLE, RUN "make", AN EXECUTABLE NAMED "htg" WILL BE CREATED. NOW THERE IS TWO OPTIONS:

1. MANUALLY ADD BIN EXECUTABLE PATH TO THE SYSTEM: TO DO THAT, EDIT ~/.bashrc FILE AND ADD THIS LINE: "export PATH=$PATH:YOURPATH", YOURPATH IS THE PATH OF THE EXECUTABLE "htg"

2. RUN "MAKE INSTALL", THE EXECUTABLE WILL BE MOVED TO EXISTING SYSTEM BINARY PATH: /USR/BIN, GIVE ROOT PERMISSION IF ASKED FOR. THIS IS EASIER OPTION AND ALSO PREFERRED.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM, OPEN A TERMINAL WHERE YOUR RAW HISTOGRAM FILE IS LOCATED AND RUN ...
"htg 'inputfile'"   OR   "htg 'inputfile' 'outputfile'"

ONE EXAMPLE HISTOGRAM HAS BEEN PROVIDED e.g. "energy.txt", TO PLOT THIS RUN "htg energy.txt". GIVE CONVENIENT INPUT BIN NUMBER, LOWER LIMIT 7.0 AND UPPER LIMIT 14.0
